# UIUC_1_2_ECE498_DataScienceAndAnalytics

You are allowed to read all the codes and files, but you are not allowed to copy directly for your assignments!!!!!!! I will not take any responsibility if you break the honor rule.         
Please try yourself and have fun working on those interesting projects! 

## Courese Informationï¼š
1. Course: CS/ECE 498 Data Science and Analytics
2. Time: 2019/01/14- 2018/05/12 
3. Teacher: Ravishankar K. Iyer (Good Professor and this course's structure really impressed me. With MPs, HWs, in class activities and projects, I could really learn things useful. This semester, I'm working as data analytics in John Deere, and I found this course really helps me a lot. Good course, strongly recommend. BTW, got highest score in midterm lol. But one thing I don't like is that the professor speaks too slowly and upload slides after class. I prefer to take notes on slider during class. Thus, I like to watch echo360 after course time.) 

## Program Infromation:
1. Python + Jupyter Notebook
2. See each program/homework under different folders. I will not upload any resources from professor, I will only upload my work including homework, source code and related notes. If you find anything I should not open source, please email me.

## MP
- MP1: Autonomous Vehicle Safety Analysis


## Tips:
1. All codes and notes will be open source after my final test (in case of copy)
2. You are allowed to read all the codes and files, but you are not allowed to copy directly for your assignments.
3. If you have any problems or ideas want to share with me, please feel free to e-mail to me: layla.laisy@gmail.com
